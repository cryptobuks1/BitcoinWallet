//Note: you'll also need to update the tablerows with newly incoming
//either executed on actions:
//1. when didSet class addressArr
//2. when completionHandler, perform insert row

//SO the logic:
//1. Load the sections dry from the hardcoded addresses. UI should display 10 sections that have no cells.
//2. As completion handler marks completion, if data is not empty or nil, update the classInstance and then reload section when data is updated.
//3. Take care of collapsing expanding later.
//Will also need the address title.

//Get the address title, get rid of txHistory array.
